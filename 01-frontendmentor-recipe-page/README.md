## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Some things that I've learn for this project is:-

- My first mistake was not adding <p> tags on <li> and found a but that didn't align the paragraphs.
- Changing the background from white on small breakpoints to colored background on bigger breakpoint.
- Adding the container padding for the larger breakpoint.
- Making the text align for the 'Nutritional' section. Setting width to a percentage fixed it.

### Continued development

- Will look on how to make the bullet points smaller.
- Change the numbered list font to bold.

### Useful resources

- [var() on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/var) - Guide on how to use CSS variables for easy referencing of colors.
- [How to change a bullet color on list](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_bullet_color.asp) - This helped me for changing the bullet color.
