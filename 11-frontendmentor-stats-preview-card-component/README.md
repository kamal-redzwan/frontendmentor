## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Using filter to overlay purple on the header image
- Add additional common devices breakpoint

### Useful resources

- [Purple Filter CSS](https://www.grepper.com/answers/419811/purple+filter+css) - This helps me to try the filter property to make the image purple, then I adjust accordingly to make it looks the same as the provided design.
- [TailwindCSS Responsive Design Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) - This documentation helps me to add common devices breakpoints. Then I adjust accordingly with what best suits my eye.
