## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Getting used to centering trick using 2 line of CSS display: grid; place-content: center;
- Learned how grid structure works in more detail by applying to this challenge
- Utility classes for changing the text color and background color of the result component
- Add CSS var that are repeated more in the code for easy access and changing them in the future

### Continued development

- Using data.json to dynamically populate the content. (Will work on this later)

### Useful resources

- [Josh Comeau Grid Tutorial](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/) - This helped me for freshen up CSS Grid concepts
